abstract = {Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 1449–1458 Abstract Trade-offs between behavioural traits promoting high life-history productivity and mortality may fuel the evolution of animal personalities. We propose that parasites, including pathogens, impose fitness costs comparable to those from predators, and influence the adaptiveness of personality traits associated with productivity (PAPs). Whether personality traits are adaptive or not may also depend on individual immunological capacity. We illustrate this using a conceptual example in which the optimal level of PAPs depends on predation, parasitism and host compensation (resistance and tolerance) of parasitism’s negative effects. We assert that inherent differences in host immune function can produce positive feedback loops between resource intake and compensation of parasitism’s costs, thereby providing variation underlying the evolution of stable personalities. Our approach acknowledges the condition dependence of immune function and co-evolutionary dynamics between hosts and parasites.},

In the present study, we investigated how group personality composition in social spiders (Stegodyphus dumicola) alters groups' average response towards predators and how their responses change with experience with important predators, Anoplolepis custodiens ants. We found that colonies composed of a mixture of ‘bold’ and ‘shy’ personality types exhibited twice as much defensive web-making behaviour as other colony compositions. Colony defensive behaviour was also more temporally stable following experience with predators for ‘mixed’ colonies than for either monotypic composition (all shy or all bold). Colonies composed of bold individuals were particularly erratic in their defensive behaviour over time. Thus, colony composition altered colony-level plasticity in response to experience with one of their most voracious predators. We additionally observed the behaviour of marked individuals within colonies to determine which individual traits were associated with task participation during encounters with predators. Individual morphology and boldness both predicted task participation at the individual level, with boldness being negatively associated with participation in the attack sequence, but positively associated with defensive silk making. Low body condition also proved to be important for predicting participation in any task. Lastly, despite a tight association between colony composition and colony defensive behaviour, we found no evidence that colony composition affected colony survival during ant attacks in situ. Instead, older and more established nests were positively associated with colony persistence during attacks."

    abstract = { AbstractCollective behavior emerges from interactions among group members who often vary in their behavior. The presence of just one or a few keystone individuals, such as leaders or tutors, may have a large effect on collective outcomes. These individuals can catalyze behavioral changes in other group members, thus altering group composition and collective behavior. The influence of keystone individuals on group function may lead to trade-offs between ecological situations, because the behavioral composition they facilitate may be suitable in one situation but not another. We use computer simulations to examine various mechanisms that allow keystone individuals to exert their influence on group members. We further discuss a trade-off between two potentially conflicting collective outcomes, cooperative prey attack and disease dynamics. Our simulations match empirical data from a social spider system and produce testable predictions for the causes and consequences of the influence of keystone individuals on group composition and collective outcomes. We find that a group’s behavioral composition can be impacted by the keystone individual through changes to interaction patterns or behavioral persistence over time. Group behavioral composition and the mechanisms that drive the distribution of phenotypes influence collective outcomes and lead to trade-offs between disease dynamics and cooperative prey attack. }

ABSTRACT={Plant-lepidopteran interactions involve complex processes encompassing molecules and regulators to counteract defense responses they develop against each other. Lepidoptera identify plants for oviposition and exploit them as larval food sources to complete their development. In turn, plants adopt different strategies to overcome and limit herbivorous damages. The insect egg deposition on leaves can already induce a number of defense responses in several plant species. This minireview deals with the main features involved in the interaction between plants and lepidopteran egg-laying, focusing on responses from both insect and plant side. We discuss different aspects of direct and indirect plant responses triggered by lepidopteran oviposition. In particular, we focus our attention on the mechanisms underlying egg-induced plant defenses that can i) directly damage the eggs such as localized hypersensitive response (HR)-like necrosis, neoplasm formation, production of ovicidal compounds and ii) indirect defenses, such as production of oviposition-induced plant volatiles (OIPVs) used to attract natural enemies (parasitoids) able to kill the eggs or hatching larvae. We provide an overview of chemical, physiological, and molecular egg-mediated plant responses induced by both specialist and generalist lepidopteran species, also dealing with effectors, elicitors, and chemical signals involved in the process. Egg-associated microorganisms are also discussed, although little is known about this third partner participating in plant-lepidopteran interactions.}

abstract = {Abstract As part of development of an IPM programme for cabbage crops in the Netherlands the possibilities for biological control of lepidopteran pests by means of inundative releases of Trichogramma species is examined. The studies involve pre-introductory research to select effective Trichogramma species/strains. This paper deals with laboratory research on the host-selection process. We examined whether strains of Trichogramma evanescens Westwood prefer one of the three most harmful lepidopteran pest species in cabbage, Mamestra brassicae, Pieris brassicae and Pieris rapae when these are offered simultaneously to the parasitoids. The most important aspect of this paper is the development of a fast and reliable method to determine host preference. It appears from the evaluation of the different methods used in this study that direct observation of the parasitization behaviour of the wasp is necessary to determine preference in a reliable way. Differences were found in host preferences between strains of one Trichogramma species. The differential acceptance and preference of the three host species is used to select Trichogramma strains as potential biological control agents.

Es wurde überprüft, ob Herkünfte von T. evanescens einen der drei gefährlichen Kohlschädlinge, M. brassicae, P. brassicae und P. rapae bevorzugten, wenn diese drei Lepidopteren gleichzeitig angeboten wurden. Der wichtigste Aspekt war es, eine schnelle und zuverlässige Methode zur Bestimmung der Wirtspräferenz zu entwik-keln. Aufgrund der Auswertung der verschiedenen in dieser Untersuchung angewandten Metho-den ergab sich, daß es notwendig ist, das Parasitierungsverhalten der Schlupfwespen direkt zu beobachten, um eine zuverlässige Aussage über die Wirtspräferenz zu erlangen. Es traten Unterschiede bezüglich der Wirtspräferenz zwischen verschiedenen Herkünften einer Tricho-gramma-Art auf. Die unterschiedliche Annahme und Bevorzugung der drei Wirte wird ausge-nutzt, um geeignete Trichogramma-Herkünfte zur biologischen Schädlingsbekämpfung auszu-wählen.},

    abstract = "{Parasitic wasps employ a wide range of chemical cues to find their hosts. Very recently, we discovered how 2 closely related egg parasitoids, Trichogramma brassicae and Trichogramma evanescens, exploit the anti-aphrodisiac pheromone benzyl cyanide of one of their hosts, the gregarious large cabbage white butterfly Pieris brassicae that deposits a clutch of more than 20 eggs per oviposition bout. The pheromone is transferred by male butterflies to females during mating to enforce female monogamy. On detecting the anti-aphrodisiac, the tiny parasitic wasps ride on a mated female butterfly to a host plant and then parasitize her freshly laid eggs. The present study demonstrates that both wasp species similarly exploit the anti-aphrodisiac mixture of methyl salicylate and indole of another host, the more common solitary small cabbage white butterfly Pieris rapae that deposits only one egg at a time. Interestingly, this behavior is innate in T. brassicae, whereas T. evanescens learns it after one successful ride on a mated female butterfly. Moreover, we show that the wasps only respond to the anti-aphrodisiacs of the 2 cabbage white butterflies when the ubiquitous compounds are part of a complete mated female odor blend. Obviously, parasitic wasps use the sophisticated espionage-and-ride strategy to find eggs of different gregarious and solitary host species. From the wasps’ perspective there seems to be a trade-off between the abundance and egg-laying behavior of the butterflies. Our findings suggest that Pieris butterflies are under strong selective pressure to minimize the use of an anti-aphrodisiac.}",

abstract = "Predator–prey dynamics is most simply and commonly described by Lotka–Volterra-type ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for continuous population density variables in the limit of large population sizes. One popular extension of these ODEs is the so-called Rosenzweig–MacArthur model in which various interaction rates between the populations have a nonlinear dependence on the prey concentration. Nonlinear ‘functional responses’ of this type were originally proposed by Holling on the basis of a general argument concerning the allocation of a predator's time between two activities: ‘prey searching’ and ‘prey handling’. Although these functional responses are constructed in terms of the behaviour of an individual predator, they are routinely incorporated at the population level in models that include reproduction and death. In this paper we derive a novel three variable model for the simplest possible mathematical formulation of predator–prey dynamics that allows the interplay between these various processes to take place, on their different characteristic timescales. We study its properties in detail and show how it reduces to Holling's functional responses in special limits. As a result we are able to establish direct links between individual-level and population-level behaviour in the context of these well-known functional responses."

Here, we investigated the relationship between host boldness/exploration tendency and gastro-intestinal helminth infection in invasive Eastern grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis). We used direct helminth counts, data rarely available in host-parasite studies that often used less reliable indirect estimates of infection. We predicted that bolder animals with a strong exploration tendency will have higher parasite load than shy, less explorative hosts. We examined two parameters of parasite infection: infection status and intensity of infection. Individual personality of 207 grey squirrels was assessed by capture-mark-recapture (CMR), calculating the trappability and trap diversity indices as estimates of boldness and exploration, respectively. Since both indices were strongly correlated, we used PCA to derive a single score (first component) which had a high value for bold, exploring animals. At the end of the study, 77 individuals were euthanized and gastro-intestinal helminths were identified and counted. Overall 73% of grey squirrels were infected by Strongyloides robustus with the intensity of infection varying from 1 to 86 worms (mean ± SE = 10.7 ± 2.1 helminths per host). We found that bolder, more explorative animals were more likely to be infected by S. robustus. However, host personality was not related to parasite intensity, which was instead positively associated with host body mass. Our results confirm that differences in personality-related host behaviour can influence the distribution of infections within host populations and stimulate further questions on whether such personality-parasite relationships may affect the invasion process."

abstract = {Summary.  We propose a new method for estimating parameters in models that are defined by a system of non-linear differential equations. Such equations represent changes in system outputs by linking the behaviour of derivatives of a process to the behaviour of the process itself. Current methods for estimating parameters in differential equations from noisy data are computationally intensive and often poorly suited to the realization of statistical objectives such as inference and interval estimation. The paper describes a new method that uses noisy measurements on a subset of variables to estimate the parameters defining a system of non-linear differential equations. The approach is based on a modification of data smoothing methods along with a generalization of profiled estimation. We derive estimates and confidence intervals, and show that these have low bias and good coverage properties respectively for data that are simulated from models in chemical engineering and neurobiology. The performance of the method is demonstrated by using real world data from chemistry and from the progress of the autoimmune disease lupus.},

A numerical example illustrates the application of Bayesian techniques. In many cases one is interested in parameters which are infinite dimensional (e.g. functions). Bayesian techniques offer a sound theoretical and computational paradigm, through probability measures on Banach space.

abstract = {Abstract Colour plays a prominent role in species recognition; therefore, understanding the proximate basis of pigmentation can provide insight into reproductive isolation and speciation. Colour differences between taxa may be the result of regulatory differences or be caused by mutations in coding regions of the expressed genes. To investigate these two alternatives, we studied the pigment composition and the genetic basis of coloration in two divergent dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) subspecies, the slate-coloured and Oregon juncos, which have evolved marked differences in plumage coloration since the Last Glacial Maximum. We used HPLC and light microscopy to investigate pigment composition and deposition in feathers from four body areas. We then used RNA-seq to compare the relative roles of differential gene expression in developing feathers and sequence divergence in transcribed loci under common-garden conditions. Junco feathers differed in eumelanin and pheomelanin content and distribution. Within subspecies, in lighter feathers melanin synthesis genes were downregulated (including PMEL, TYR, TYRP1, OCA2 and MLANA), and ASIP was upregulated. Feathers from different body regions also showed differential expression of HOX and WNT genes. Feathers from the same body regions that differed in colour between the two subspecies showed differential expression of ASIP and three other genes (MFSD12, KCNJ13 and HAND2) associated with pigmentation in other taxa. Sequence variation in the expressed genes was not related to colour differences. Our findings support the hypothesis that differential regulation of a few genes can account for marked differences in coloration, a mechanism that may facilitate the rapid phenotypic diversification of juncos.},

	abstract = {A basic issue in ecology is the relation between extinction and population size. One of the clearest manifestations of a population threshold for extinction is the critical community size below which infections like measles do not persist. The current generation of stochastic models overestimates the observed critical community size for measles, generating much less persistence of infection than is observed. The inclusion of a more biologically realistic model for the duration of infection produced a much closer fit to the actual critical community size and explains previously undescribed high-frequency oscillations in measles incidence.},

    abstract = { Most mathematical models used to understand the dynamical patterns seen in the incidence of childhood viral diseases, such as measles, employ a simple, but epidemiologically unrealistic, description of the infection and recovery process. The inclusion of more realistic descriptions of the recovery process is shown to cause a significant destabilization of the model. When there is seasonal variation in disease transmission this destabilization leads to the appearance of complex dynamical patterns with much lower levels of seasonality than previously predicted. More generally, this study illustrates how detailed dynamical properties of a model may depend in an important way on the assumptions made in the formulation of the model. }

    abstract = { There is increasing evidence that animal groups can maintain coordinated behaviour and make collective decisions based on simple interaction rules. Effective collective action may be further facilitated by individual variation within groups, particularly through leader–follower polymorphisms. Recent studies have suggested that individual-level personality traits influence the degree to which individuals use social information, are attracted to conspecifics, or act as leaders/followers. However, evidence is equivocal and largely limited to laboratory studies. We use an automated data-collection system to conduct an experiment testing the relationship between personality and collective decision-making in the wild. First, we report that foraging flocks of great tits (Parus major) show strikingly synchronous behaviour. A predictive model of collective decision-making replicates patterns well, suggesting simple interaction rules are sufficient to explain the observed social behaviour. Second, within groups, individuals with more reactive personalities behave more collectively, moving to within-flock areas of higher density. By contrast, proactive individuals tend to move to and feed at spatial periphery of flocks. Finally, comparing alternative simulations of flocking with empirical data, we demonstrate that variation in personality promotes within-patch movement while maintaining group cohesion. Our results illustrate the importance of incorporating individual variability in models of social behaviour. }

Recent studies have investigated how the phenotypic composition of groups or aggregations (e.g., its average phenotype or phenotypic variance) affects ecological and social processes, and how multi-level selection can drive phenotypic covariance among interacting individuals. However, we argue that these questions are rarely studied together. We present a unified framework to address this gap, and discuss how group phenotypic composition (GPC) can impact on processes ranging from individual fitness to population demography. By emphasising the breadth of topics affected, we hope to motivate more integrated empirical studies of the ecological and evolutionary implications of GPC."
